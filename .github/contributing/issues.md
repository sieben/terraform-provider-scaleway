# Issues

A great way to contribute to the project is to send a detailed report when you encounter a bug.
We always appreciate a well-written, thorough bug report, and will thank you for it!

## Issue Reporting Checklists

We welcome issues of all kinds including feature requests, bug reports, and general questions.
Below you'll find checklists with guidelines for well-formed issues of each type.
Before opening a new issue, we appreciate you reviewing open issues to see if there are any similar requests.
If there is a match, thumbs up the issue with a üëç and leave a comment if you have additional information.

### Reporting security issues

If you have any issue regarding security, please notify us by sending an email to [security@scaleway.com](mailto:security@scaleway.com).

‚ö†Ô∏è Please _DO NOT_ create a GitHub issue. ‚ö†Ô∏è

We will follow up with you promptly with more information and a plan for remediation.
We currently do not offer a paid security bounty program, but we would love to send some Scaleway swag your way along with our deepest gratitude for your assistance in making Scaleway a more secure Cloud ecosystem.

### [Bug Reports](https://github.com/scaleway/terraform-provider-scaleway/issues/new?template=Bug_Report.md)

 - [ ] __Test against latest release__: Make sure you test against the latest released version.
   It is possible we already fixed the bug you're experiencing.

 - [ ] __Search for possible duplicate reports__: It's helpful to keep bug reports consolidated to one thread, so do a quick search on existing bug reports to check if anybody else has reported the same thing.
   You can [scope searches by the label "bug"](https://github.com/scaleway/terraform-provider-scaleway/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3Abug) to help narrow things down.

 - [ ] __Include steps to reproduce__: Provide steps to reproduce the issue, along with your `.tf` files, with secrets removed, so we can try to reproduce it.
   Without this, it makes it much harder to fix the issue.

 - [ ] __For panics, include `crash.log`__: If you experienced a panic, please create a [gist](https://gist.github.com) of the *entire* generated crash log for us to look at.
   Double check no sensitive items were in the log (For instance token, private keys or other secrets).

### [Feature Requests](https://github.com/scaleway/terraform-provider-scaleway/issues/new?labels=enhancement&template=Feature_Request.md)

## Suggesting a feature

 - [ ] __Search for possible duplicate requests__: It's helpful to keep requests consolidated to one thread, so do a quick search on existing requests to check if anybody else has reported the same thing.
   You can [scope searches by the label "enhancement"](https://github.com/scaleway/terraform-provider-scaleway/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3Aenhancement) to help narrow things down.

 - [ ] __Include a use case description__: In addition to describing the behavior of the feature you'd like to see added, it's helpful to also lay out the reason why the feature would be important and how it would benefit Terraform users.

 - [ ] __Urgency__: What is the priority of this feature? Is it a nice to have or a required feature for a particular use case?  

### [Questions](https://github.com/scaleway/terraform-provider-scaleway/issues/new?labels=question&template=Question.md)

 - [ ] __Search for answers in Terraform documentation__: We're happy to answer questions in GitHub Issues, but it helps reduce issue churn and maintainer workload if you work to [find answers to common questions in the documentation](https://www.terraform.io/docs/providers/scaleway/index.html).
   Oftentimes Question issues result in documentation updates to help future users, so if you don't find an answer, you can give us pointers for where you'd expect to see it in the docs.

## Issues Lifecycle

1. The issue is reported.

2. The issue is verified and categorized by a Terraform collaborator.
   Categorization is done via GitHub labels. We generally use a two-label system of (1) issue/PR type, and (2) section of the codebase.
   Type is one of "bug", "enhancement", "documentation", or "question", and section is usually the Scaleway product name (e.g k8s, instance, ...).

3. An initial triage process determines whether the issue is critical and must be addressed immediately, or can be left open for community discussion.

4. The issue is addressed in a pull request or commit. The issue number will be referenced in the commit message so that the code that fixes it is clearly linked.

5. The issue is closed.
   Sometimes, valid issues will be closed because they are tracked elsewhere or non-actionable.
   The issue is still indexed and available for future viewers, or can be re-opened if necessary.
