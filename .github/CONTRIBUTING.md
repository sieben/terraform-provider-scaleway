# Contributing to Terraform - Scaleway Provider

**First:** if you're unsure or afraid of _anything_, ask for help!
You can submit a work in progress (WIP) pull request, or file an issue with the parts you know.
We'll do our best to guide you in the right direction, and let you know if there are guidelines you will need to follow.
We want people to be able to participate without fear of doing the wrong thing.
